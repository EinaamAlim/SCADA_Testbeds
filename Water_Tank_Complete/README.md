# Water Tank Testbed Overview
We created a water tank tower model that simulates the switch-based control of adjusting the amount of water flow in and out of its reservoir, regulating the pressurized water distribution. The human-machine interface (HMI) includes the water tank, the various switches, and a plot to indicate its operation over time.<br>

The amount of water in the tank relative to the whole capacity is represented by the term Water Level, which is displayed in the upper left corner of the tank. This is also plotted against time in the plot in the upper right corner of the HMI. The HMI exhibits 2 main switches: a pump (circle in the lower left) and a valve (red triangles by the tank). The pump provides/halts water flow into the system and the valve releases/tightens the water pressure. There is an automatic mode that the system will use to regulate the water level, as well as a manual mode that provides the operator with control of the pump and valve switches.
