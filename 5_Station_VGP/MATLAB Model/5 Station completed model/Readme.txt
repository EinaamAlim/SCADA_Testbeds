Model created By Rishabh Das

Designed in MATLAB 2015b
This program might generate rate transition error if executed in a MATLAB version older than 2015b. To overcome this the model has to be exported to the specified MATLAB version using MATLAB 2015b.Adaptive rate transition block should be used to inherit the sample rate of various subsystems.
